This project aims to collect and log accurate Cisco Switch information of individual ports in Rutgers residential dorms using inexpensive/existing hardware. The Linkrunner Fluke product was previously used to collect this information. All information collected by the Linkrunner Fluke was previously hand recorded by consultants and later manually entered into spreadsheet software like MS Excel or Google Sheets. My project collects this related information automatically with minimal user interaction and automates the process of generating and updating the spreadsheet containing collected information. The project utilizes Bash and Python scripting to achieve the described result. The script is currently functional from a command line interface on a Debian based Linux distribution (NOTE: must set the wired interface appropriately in both the shell and python script) and on MacOS. There are plans to extend this functionality to Microsoft Windows based machines (Potentially via a graphical Java based implementation) or to create a Live Linux image so that it can be run on existing hardware without the need for any software related changes.
